- Scales
    - Scales Over Tunes
    - Pick a tune you want to learn.
    - Learn one position for each scale needed to solo over the tune. 
    - Practice one or two scale patterns for each scale from memory. 
    - Solo over that tune using those scale shapes and patterns.
- Arpeggios Over Common Progressions
    - Pick a common jazz chord progression, such as I-VI-ii-V.
    - Learn one two octave and one, one-octave shape for each chord. 
    - Solo over a I-VI-ii-V backing track with those arpeggio shapes. 
    - Move on to a second arpeggio position and repeat.
- Ascending 3rds （三度模进）
    - Choose a scale to focus on in your studies.
    - Practice ascending 3rds over that scale with a metronome. 
    - Start in one key, and then move to others from there.
    - Increase the tempo when you feel ready to move on.
- ii V I Licks
    - Learn a ii V I lick by ear or from a book.
    - Practice that lick in 12 keys with a metronome. Ø Solo with the lick over a backing track.
    - Write out two to three similar licks.
    - Apply those similar licks to your soloing practice.

# <a name="Harmonic_Exercises"></a>Harmonic Exercises
- Chords Over Tunes
    - Pick a tune.
    - Choose a chord type to focus on, Drop 2 for example.
    - Pick a string set, such as the top-4 strings.
    - Play those chords, Drop 2 top-4 strings, through the tune.
    - Challenge yourself further by using inversions.
    - Start with a metronome and move to a backing track when ready.
    - Choose a tune, it can be the same from the previous exercise. Ø Learn the 357 triads for each chord in the tune.
    - Comp those triads over the tune with a metronome.
    - Move on to a backing track when comfortable.

- Comping Over ii V I Minor
    - Choose a chord type to work with, Drop 3 for example.
    - Pick a string set to focus on, such as 6432.
    - Play the root shape for the iim7b5 chord.
    - Move to the closest V7alt and Im7 chords from that starting point. Ø From there, move to the first inversion iim7b5 chord.
    - Repeat the process from that new chord shape. Ø Use a metronome or backing track to keep time.
- Bass lines Over Tunes
    - Pick a tune.
    - Play the root note on the first beat of each new chord.
    - Play a chromatic approach note on the beat before each root. Ø Play two chromatic notes approaching each root note.
    - Add a diatonic note on the remaining beat.
    - In 4/4 time the formula is root-diatonic-chromatic-chromatic. Ø If comfortable, add chords on top of the bass notes


# POINTS TO REMEMBER -- contíd
- A good musician has a large repertoire in his head - he doesn’t rely heavily on books. • Music doesn’t care who plays it.
- “Play what is there, we don’t need to hear you lying” - Art Blakey
- When you finally play what is in your head, you will meet yourself for the first time.
- “It takes a long time to play like yourself’ - Miles
- You can answer all your questions about jazz by listening: LISTEN! LISTEN! LISTEN!
- When you solo, use repetition and sequence, don’t ramble. This allows the listener to anticipate what you
-re doing. This is known as thematic improvisation. Sonny Rollins’ solos are a great example of this.
- The interval from B flat to E contains three tones (Bflat =>C=>D==>E ) hence the name tritone.
- Very few adults take the time required to learn to play jazz (or even simply to listen to it!)
- If you want to keep the harmony outlined, play chord tones on beats one and three.
- The root third, fifth and seventh outline the harmony.
- A characteristic of Bebop solos is that they outline harmony very explicitly.
- Do you have a dozen tunes memorized? Know the melody and the form, be able to write out the chord
-rogressions (Jamey has 1000 tunes memorized!)
- Learn some tunes, and listen to music throughout the day to keep them in your head.
- Put your tune repertoire in a notebook so you can review it.
- As an exercise in getting your solos to sound like what you hear in your head, put a play-a-long CD on and
-lay four bars, then sing four bars, then play four bars ... then sing, etc.
- To execute your objective: Think it - Say it - Do it!
- The average person has to learn to play in time - it does not come naturally. You can use a metronome.
- Start to improvise early in your musical education.
- I’m interested in seeing people play music throughout their entire life.
- If you don’t improvise every day what is the point of practicing scales and chords?
- Music is supposed to be fun - have fun when you practice.
- When I asked some musicians how much of the day they spend thinking music they responded 24 hours
-er day!
- When you solo, look for common tones between changes, anticipate, think ahead. Think about the subse-
-uent chord scale while you are improvising on the current one. It is not that hard, do it soon to prove this
-o yourself. This is called “playing across the bar lines.”
- The melody to a song is called the head.
- Obstacles are opportunities. Turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones.
- Don’t approach your practice as if you have to learn a great deal of information and acquire a great deal of
-kill so you then can play - instead start playing NOW! ! !
- If you play straight 8th notes you can play the bebop scale for a measure and end on the degree of the
-cale that you started on (most of our scales have seven notes and don’t work out this way.) The Bebop
-cale gives you 8 notes per measure instead of seven when played in 8th notes.
- The effective use of the Bebop scale often separates those who can play from those who are trying to play. • Don’t forget that a chord symbol implies a scale (horizontal) and a chord (vertical).
- You can’t listen to records enough - it is so very important!
- If you don’t have a good sound who is going to care about what you have to say - even if you have great
-deas.
- To find a lowered 7th just go down a whole step from the root.
- To find a sharp 9 go up a minor third from the root.
- The 3rd and 7th are the most important notes in outlining chord quality. The root is always assumed.
- Tape yourself and listen back objectively. Don’t be afraid to hear yourself as others hear you.
- In 4/4 time, if you want to give harmonic stability, play chord tones (1,3,5, and 7) on beats one and three.
- DaveBrubeck’s“TakeFive”(in5/4)isreallybarsof3/4followedbybarsof2/4.12312,12312,12312 • Lydian is a favorite substitute for major (especially in tune endings).
- Chuck Sher’s New Real Books are accurate.
- The tunes that jazz players like and that are challenging often have pretty chord tones in the original
-elody. Pretty notes can be the major 7th, 9th or #4 in MAJOR; b7, 9 and 4 in MINOR.
- Strive to solo on a tune, without playing the melody and without a rhythm section, in such a way that a
-istener could name the tune (this means you are doing a good job of outlining the harmony).
- The music is between your ears...

9. Play 6th chords (1, 3, 5, and 6th tones of the scale)
